Roast N Toast is a react app where users can login or signup to interact with other users. Users can upload photos, which then can either be "toasted" or "roasted". For each photo, there is a seperate comment section for nice comments vs mean ones. User can add comments of either variety, and upvote other comments. Users can also upvote photos, and filter photos by most upvoted.
